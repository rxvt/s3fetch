## Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.0

### Python Version Requirements

**Before (v1.x):**
```bash
# Supported Python 3.7+
python3.7 -m pip install s3fetch
```

**After (v2.0):**
```bash
# Requires Python 3.10+
python3.10 -m pip install s3fetch
```

### Development Setup

**Before (v1.x):**
```bash
# Poetry-based development
poetry install
poetry run s3fetch --help
```

**After (v2.0):**
```bash
# Hatch-based development
hatch env create
hatch run s3fetch --help
```

### Testing

**Before (v1.x):**
```bash
# Poetry and Nox
poetry run nox -s tests
```

**After (v2.0):**
```bash
# Hatch testing
hatch test -a
hatch run test_unit
hatch run test_integration
```

### CLI Usage

The CLI interface remains the same for end users:
```bash
s3fetch s3://bucket/prefix/ /local/path/
```

### Library Usage

Public API functions remain compatible, but internal imports may have changed:
```python
# Still works in v2.0
from s3fetch.api import download_objects
```
